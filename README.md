- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxuvious
- 👀 I’m interested in multimedia programing and automation, but more importatnly, for long term problem solving, I'm learning as much pure mathamatics as I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, linux os development, mathematics, and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video/audio editing and automation.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is on my email maxuvious@gmail.com (I look to change this to my own service at some point)
